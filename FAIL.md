### reporting failure
* what has been done
    - came up w/ an amazing dataset idea - use aligulac.com sc2 database
    - created a runnable environemnt in docker
    - sc2 db uploads on startup to postresql
    - we can query using java.jdbc
    - load data from sql to datomic, building references
    - created meaningful and fun queries ,which are exactly what i intended
    - absolutely enjoyed querying the amazing world of sc2  and getting the answer i expected  
* unfulfilled
    - no automation for uploading from sql to datomic
    - and sadly, no ui

### points to consider

* underestimated amount of time needed to properly complete the task
* the time of the challenge was moderately busy
* ecountered proplems w/ connecting REPL to figwheel in docker
* building this system turned out to be a really engaging process, i will take the next challege
* this time - come up w/ a better plan and deadline

### completion note

* a challenging challenge, a short but real adventure
* honestly it's been a success - data was uploaded and queried 
---
* i accept the next challenge - complete the system
    - a more precise plan, design
    - cold-headed time estimate
